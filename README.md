This app functions to create stock portfolios.  Users can create accounts,
login/logout, add friends(which gives them access to view their portfolios),
create posts to timeline(which can be seen on feed if friended). Users can also
sign up for competitions, in which each user is given a fixed amount of funds and
given a fixed amount of time to grow their portfolio.  The investor with the highest
valued portfolio at the end of said time limit is the winner. Winners earn badges.
